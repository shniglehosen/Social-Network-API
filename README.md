# Social-Network-API

## Description
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list without using MySQL.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Installation
Copy the github code link. Open the terminal in VS Coode and type: git clone *paste github link*
Once that is done, open the integrated termincal in the home directory and type: npm i

## Usage
In the integrated terminal in the home directory, type npm run seed to get the data we want to use.
Then, type npm start to initiate the program and local host.
Since there are no public facing views, we will use an API tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to follow the routes
